  "I had the pleasure of hiring Jess for a role as backend developer on my team at Cool Gray.
  Jess is a fixer and a doer. Give him a challenge or a problem and he buckles down and keeps on working on it, until he finds a solution - and continuously a great solution that is.
  He was the lead developer on what at the time was the largest digital project Cool Gray had ever undertaken and he solved every aspect with bravour.
  He always brings good mood to the team and he is great company both professionally and personally.
  Jess has my highest recommendations."
