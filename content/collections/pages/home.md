about_me: |-
  I love everything Laravel and Vue, and I love preaching the Laravel gospel to those willing to listen. And sometimes also the unwilling. I am a fullstack developer, and I know my way around the various javascript framework-of-the-day (Vue, React etc.). I can take your brilliant design and turn it into a fully functional web/mobile/desktop app with (relative) ease.


  I am a certified SCRUM master and believe that agile is the only way to go. I'm also very comfortable in a lead role, and I'm confident that my many years as a developer, is a great benefit in such a position.


  I am very motivated when it comes to things that I find interesting, and I enjoy working in an informal environment. I'm always up for a good laugh and a beer with my boss and co-workers.


  I'm a technology hungry, byte minded code monkey, with an eagle eye for details, always trying to reach the next level.


  By the way, be warned. I have quite a few tattoos. None of which will eat you.

This site will tell you more about who I am, what I do and what I have done. Professionally that is. Don't get too excited.
